A bundle of correlated maps are organized as a directory, with a structure like:

```
<map_dir>                        # Defined by FLAGS_map_dir
  |-- base_map.xml               # Defined by FLAGS_base_map_filename
  |-- routing_map.bin            # Defined by FLAGS_routing_map_filename
  |-- sim_map.bin                # Defined by FLAGS_sim_map_filename
  |-- default_end_way_point.txt  # Defined by FLAGS_end_way_point_filename
```

- `base_map` is the most complete map that has all roads, lane geometry and labels. The other maps are generated based on `base_map`.

- `routing_map` has the topology of the lanes in `base_map`. It can be generated by command:

```
dir_name=modules/map/data/demo # example map directory
./scripts/generate_routing_topo_graph.sh --map_dir ${dir_name}
```

- `sim_map` is a light weight version of `base_map` for dreamview visualization. It has reduced data density for better runtime performance. It can be generated by command:

```
dir_name=modules/map/data/demo # example map directory
bazel-bin/modules/map/tools/sim_map_generator --map_dir=${dir_name} --output_dir=${dir_name}
```
